# Coffee in-the Cities
##Analysis of the battleground between Caribou Coffee and Starbucks

## Introduction
Though I personally don't drink much coffee, it's hard to argue that there aren't many others who do. There are plenty of options for those who want a sip prepared for them on their way to work, school, or errands. In the Twin Cities, two players have a formidable presence: Caribou Coffee and Starbucks Coffee.

### Caribou Coffee
This chain started in the 90s, and is especially known in the Midwest. Caribou Coffee has a huge presence in the Twin Cities, which is not a surprise considering that their first coffee shop was opened in Edina. There are five Caribou Coffee locations within the Mall of America! <a href= "https://locations.cariboucoffee.com/us">However, good luck finding them elsewhere</a>. There are a smattering of locations on the East Coast, mainy in Southern states, but as a native of New Jersey, Caribou struck me as a "foreign" chain. However, we have two Dunkin Donuts in every town, which is a uniquely New England and Mid-Atlantic phenomenon.

### Starbucks Coffee
Known worldwide, this is the coffee shop founded in Seattle that made lattes ubiquitous. There's plenty of Starbucks even in the Twin Cities. Starbucks are attached to many Target stores, and with Target being headquartered in the area, many Twin Cities Starbucks are actually licensed locations inside Target stores. For the sake of this analysis I will not differentiate between corporate and licensed stores, but in a future Starbucks-specific analysis, I may.

## Data
I used three main sources of data for this analysis. For the <a href = 'https://locations.cariboucoffee.com/'>Caribou Coffee</a> and < a href = "https://www.starbucks.com/store-locator">Starbucks Coffee</a> locations, I used their respective websites. For shapefile and Census data, I used the data portal of the Metropolitan Council.
